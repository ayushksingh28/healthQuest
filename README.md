# healthQuest

This is basically a repository to build an application which fetches information from PubMed using Haystack and curates that information into proper responses to the given query using LLM.

The application was suppposed to be using Mixtral 8*7B model but instead there was some error so the application wasn't able to identify the model but I have added a colab notebook which works fine using your Hugging Face Access Token(Use a "write" token) and the email that you have used to register yourself on PubMed website.
